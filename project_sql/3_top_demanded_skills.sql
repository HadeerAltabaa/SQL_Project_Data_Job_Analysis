Insights Summary:
- Foundational Dominance: To be competitive, job seekers must prioritize SQL. 
    It is the most universally requested skill, serving as the "language of data" 
    across almost all sectors.
- The Technical Core: A "Gold Standard" skill set for a modern Data Analyst includes 
    a combination of SQL for data retrieval, Excel/Python for processing, and 
    Tableau/Power BI for presentation.
- Broad Utility vs. Specialization: While Excel provides broad utility, the demand 
    for Python indicates that the market is leaning toward more scalable and automated 
    analytical workflows.
